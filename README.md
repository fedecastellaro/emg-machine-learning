# Platform for the Acquisition and Processing of Electromyographic Signals Oriented to Biomedical Applications. 

## Overview

Integral system designed to be able to capture any EMG signal produced by the body (in a non-invasive way) to be later translated by a previously trained neural network into an equivalent movement. 
The machine learning algorithm, the sampling of the analogue signals, and all the mathematical processing were all integrated in a 65x50mm PCB, making it 100% portable.

## PCB Design

It includes :
- WIFI/Bluetooth antenna for external connectivity
- Fully isolated USB connection
- 4 low noise differencial amplifiers
- Lithium-ion battery charger

## Software

This proyect includes three different king of software implementations:
- In C/C++ for the microcontroller.
- In Python for the PC.
- In Kotling for the Android App.
